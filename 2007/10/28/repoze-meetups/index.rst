Repoze Meetups
==============

.. post:: 2007/10/28

As Paul Everitt `recently`_ `mentioned`_, the `dudes`_ are back! Three (self-described,ex-Zope Corp) graybeards doing what they love to do best! Using Zope. But this is not your father's Zope (assuming your dad used Zope in the early 2000s) this is Repoze, which integrates Zope technologies with WSGI and reusable Python middleware.  `One of the dudes`_ will be delivering the first of a two part presentation on `Repoze`_ tonight in Washington, DC, USA. Next month,
he'll be joined by `the other dude`_ and possibly Paul Everitt himself.  Please help spread the word about this event by pointing people towards\ `http://zpugdc.org/meetings/mtg57`_. Or, if you prefer "Web 2.0":
