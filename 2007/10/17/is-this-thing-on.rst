... because it is showing up on `planet`_! Sorry about the duplicates. I have recreated my blog using Just Plone ™ (and I didn't realize syndication was turned on already ;-)) In any event, here it is!

And while I have your attention, I've decided that I am `joining Tomster`_ and others in pledging allegiance to the Plone by joining the `10% Manifesto`_ as proposed by `Geir Bækholt at Jarn`_.

I will schedule my Plone days at the beginning of each month starting this month (October 2007) and announce them here.

First announcment coming soon.
