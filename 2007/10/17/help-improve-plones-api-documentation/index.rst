Help Improve Plone's API Documentation
======================================

.. post:: 2007/10/17

**Sponsor my trip to the Plone Doccom Sprint in California**

I'm travelling from Washington, DC, USA to Mountain View, CA, USA June 26 - 29 to participate in the 2007 `Plone Doccomm Sprint`_. My main focus will be updating Plone's online API documentation (available at `http://api.plone.org`_). If you are interested in seeing this done and would like to help, please consider making a donation to help offset the cost of my airfare. In return, I will create and upload API documentation for:

- Plone-2.5.3
- Archetypes-1.4.4
- CMF-1.6.4

and:

- Plone-3.0
- Archetypes-1.5.0
- CMF-2.1.0

I plan to use either `epydoc`_ or `pudge`_. Suggestions welcome! For more information please see:

- `http://plone.org/development/teams/documentation/documentation-tracker/37`_

and:

- `http://www.nabble.com/Turn-off-api.plone.org--tf3602743.html#a10064645`_

(I originally suggested we turn off api.plone.org but that was met with a resounding "no!")

And without further ado, please consider making a donation! Any amount is welcome; the goal is $600 USD. I will make an announcement once I've reached it (so people don't give too much).

Thank You!!!
