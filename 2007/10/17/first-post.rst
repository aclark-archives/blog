Why? Because Plone allows me to do so. But also:

-  I have been reading a lot of Plone blogs lately and they have inspired me to write my own.
-  I want to interact with other Plonistas.
-  I want to get my web 2.0 **ON**.

To that end, this post is about my `build tools`_ and how I love them. There are much better ways to accomplish what I'm doing here. I'm reminding myself this, as much as the reader. So why do I continue to use them? Good question. I'll save the answer for another post, but for now you should be aware of these much better alternatives:

-  `Buildout`_
-  `Buildit`_
-  `Instance Manager`_

I used Buildout for the first time at the `Baarn UI Sprint 2007`_ and really enjoyed it. I have also used and enjoyed Chris McDonough's Buildit. That may be where I end up and there are several more to choose from, but for now I still enjoy typing:

::

    $ newzope test-site ProductA ProductB ProductC

and having a working instance a few seconds later with Product{A,B,C} installed. Of course this requires I have a working Zope already... and that I edit Zope's ``skel/etc/zope.conf``... but nothing is perfect and old habits die hard.
