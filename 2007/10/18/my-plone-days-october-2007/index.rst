My Plone Days October 2007
==========================

.. post:: 2007/10/18

My focus will be `PloneSoftwareCenter (PSC)`_. That's right! You heard it here first. After a little prodding on IRC from Martin Aspeli, Steve McMahon, and Geir BÃ¦kholt I am declaring myself the "owner" of `PSC`_ (read: responsible for releases). I'll spend my first two days (16 hours next Tuesday and Thursday, 9-5 EDT) working on `PSC`_ and getting it ready to ship (with Plone 3 compatibility).
