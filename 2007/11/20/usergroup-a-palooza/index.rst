Usergroup-a-palooza
===================

.. post:: 2007/11/20

Today at the behest of `Tres Seaver`_ and `ZUG-SIG`_ , I updated `http://www.zope.org/Resources/UserGroups`_. Most of the information came from\ `Chris Calloway`_, I just converted it to structured text. Now it's `better than the old one`_ and should be easier for "humans" to maintain. As Chris would say, "Yay us." What I continue to find amazing is:

-  The number of user groups that have `come and gone`_ over the years.
-  The number of user group `unification attempts`_ that have `come and gone`_ over the years.

I don't really have a point, other than to say that `http://www.zope.org/Resources/UserGroups`_ looks a lot like `http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups`_ and `http://plone.org/support/local-user-groups`_, and to me that is A Good Thing â„¢. It suggests that:

-  We are all fighting the same battle, i.e. we all like using Python to solve the world's problems.
-  We really have entered into the `fourth age of Zope`_, i.e. Zope is becoming part of the Python vernacular again, and not in a bad way.
-  There is still more work to be done, e.g. Chris Calloway once told me he didn't believe in using a "Super Robot Chicken" (Web 2.0 euphemism?) to unite all of the user groups under one umbrella, but I am still holding my breath!

See you at the next Python/Zope/Plone/Grok/Repoze meeting! ;-)
