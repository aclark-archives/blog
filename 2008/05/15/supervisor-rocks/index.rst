Supervisor rocks!
=================

.. post:: 2008/05/15

(This is essentially a reiteration of `Carlos' previous blog entry`_. :-))

It just occurred to me that we should probably be using `Supervisor`_ all over the place in our buildouts. Here's why:

-  Starting and stopping Zope and ZEO separately is no fun.
-  Using Supervisor is easy and fun.

Here's how to do it:

-  Add a part to your buildout.cfg file (this is the fun part):

::

    parts =
        ...
        supervisor
        ...

    [supervisor]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    egg = supervisor

-  Create a configuration file (this is not as fun; we need a recipe for this!) in your buildout called etc/supervisord.conf and add the following (cargo-cult style):

::

    [inet_http_server]port=127.0.0.1:9999#username=admin#password=admin[supervisord]logfile=%(here)s/../var/log/supervisord.loglogfile_maxbytes=50MBlogfile_backups=10loglevel=infopidfile=%(here)s/../var/supervisord.pidnodaemon=false[rpcinterface:supervisor]supervisor.rpcinterface_factory =     supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface[supervisorctl]serverurl=http://127.0.0.1:9999[program:zeo]command = %(here)s/../parts/zeo/bin/runzeopriority = 10[program:zope]command = %(here)s/../parts/instance/bin/runzopepriority = 20redirect_stderr = true

(Uncomment the admin lines if you want to password protect your supervisor.)

That's it! Now you can run buildout as normal:

::

    bin/buildout

and then startÂ  supervisor:

::

    bin/supervisord

and then use supervisorctl to start and stop your Zope and ZEO at the
same time (for fun and profit):

::

    bin/supervisorctl start allbin/supervisorctl stop all

You even get a nice web interface for free.

How cool is that? Incidentally, one thing I have always found confusing is how to stop supervisord:

::

    bin/supervisorctl shutdown

So as you can see I'm happy about this, but what would make me even happier is:

-  A buildout recipe that generates a supervisord.conf file 'on the fly'
   (i.e. when buildout runs).
-  A paster template that includes Supervisor and ZEO (perhaps a cross
   between plone\_hosting and plone3\_buildout?).
-  A Unified Installer that includes Supervisor.
-  A port of Supervisor to Windows (/me ducks).

Thoughts?

Thanks Chris McDonough of `Agendaless Consulting`_ and Mike Naberezny of `Maintainable Software,`_ plus `contributors`_ for creating/maintaining Supervisor and making my job easier :-)

(And thanks Chris and Carlos for the example configuration files `here`_ and `here`_.)
