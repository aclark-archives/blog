Join us this Saturday in irc://irc.freenode.net#PxC (channel reserved for discussion of PloneHelpCenter/PloneSoftwareCenter) at 4:00AM EDT to work on Plone.org upgrade issues, including:

-  Deploying the latest PloneSoftwareCenter code to new.plone.org and testing `collective.dist`_ against new.plone.org/products.
-  Develop and test collective.psc.mirroring. This is the PloneSoftwareCenter module responsible for copying uploads to dist.plone.org.
-  Develop and test `collective.psc.blobstorage`_ and `collective.psc.externalstorage`_ and collective.psc.filestorage (which does not exist yet). These are the modules responsible for implementing pluggable storage in PloneSoftwareCenter.

Hope to "see" you there. We have lots of jobs for lots of people if you are interested in helping.

.. _collective.dist: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.dist/0.1.9
.. _collective.psc.blobstorage: http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.psc.blobstorage
.. _collective.psc.externalstorage: http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.psc.externalstorage/
