Spaces fixed!
=============

.. post:: 2008/03/06

For those of you using Spaces in Mac OS X, I'd like to follow up my `previous post`_ with some exciting news regarding Spaces in Mac OS X 10.5.2. It's "fixed"! Thousands of former FVWM users can now rejoice as they enjoy sane desktop pager functionality. As you know, I've been tracking the development of the "Spaces... Spaces... Spaces..." hack (read: waiting for it to support 10.5.2) and I just noticed that the issue has actually been resolved by Apple, yay! See this post on macosxhints.com for more information: `http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2008021122525348`_

The short of it is, to alter the annoying spaces-follows-application behavior, do this:

::

      % defaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO

::

      % sudo killall Dock

Now Plonistas everywhere (including Tomster) can give Spaces another try!

And now, with my sincerest thanks to Apple, I leave you to go work in another Space...
