RE: collective.recipe.supervisor: Thank you!
============================================

.. post:: 2008/08/10

Since I `last wrote about supervisor`_ it's become even more easy and more fun to add it to your buildout with `collective.recipe.supervisor`_. I **really** appreciate what this recipe allows me to do (because it makes my job/life so much easier) and I want to publicly thank `Mustapha Benali, Author & Hanno Schlichting, Contributor`_.

Now, it is as simple as editing your buildout.cfg like so:

1. Add a part for supervisor:

::

    [buildout]
        parts =
            ...
            supervisor

2. Create the part:

::

    [supervisor]
    recipe = collective.recipe.supervisor
    programs =
        10 zeo ${zeo:location}/bin/runzeo ${zeo:location}
        20 instance ${instance:location}/bin/runzope ${instance:location} true

3. Run buildout:

::

    ...
    Installing supervisor.
    Getting distribution for 'supervisor'.
    Got supervisor 3.0a6.
    Getting distribution for 'elementtree>=1.2.6,<1.2.7'.

    Got elementtree 1.2.6-20050316.

    Got meld3 0.6.5.
    Getting distribution for 'medusa>=0.5.4'.
    zip_safe flag not set; analyzing archive contents...
    Got medusa 0.5.4.

    Generated script '/Users/aclark/Developer/supervisor-recipe-test/bin/memmon'.
    Generated script '/Users/aclark/Developer/supervisor-recipe-test/bin/supervisorctl'.

4. Start supervisor in the foreground:

::

    $ bin/supervisord -e debug -n

5. When everything looks ok, start supervisor 'for real':

::

    bin/supervisord

6. Once running, you can:

-  Check status:

::

    $ supervisorctl status
    instance                         RUNNING    pid 99889, uptime 0:00:04
    zeo                              RUNNING    pid 99888, uptime 0:00:04

-  Start/stop Zope/ZEO in various ways:

::

    $ bin/supervisorctl stop instance
    instance: stopped$ bin/supervisorctl stop zeo
    zeo: stopped$ bin/supervisorctl start zeo
    zeo: started$ bin/supervisorctl start instance
    instance: started$ bin/supervisorctl stop all
    zeo: stopped
    instance: stopped$ bin/supervisorctl start  all
    zeo: startedinstance: started

and generally go about your business, unfettered.
