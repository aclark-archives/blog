What I'm doing now
==================

(Based on http://sivers.org/now)

I'm in Bethesda, MD, USA staying quite focused, avoiding distractions. I spend all my time on these things: (in order of time spent)

- **Husband** to Amy
- **Owner** of Pets
- **Systems Administrator** at NIH
- **Partner, Python Web Developer** at ACLARK.NET
- **President & Executive Director** of DC Python
- **Webmaster & Executive Committee Member** at Parkwood Residents Association
- **Musician** at Headstraight

If my activities or priorities change, I'll update this page. Last update was October 2016.
