`Plone Conference 2008`_ is fast approaching and in order to avoid
embarrassment, disappointment, and a huge public outcry, I'd like to
kick off *"September 2008: The Month Of Plone.org"* (cue: daunting
music) so that we can finish upgrading plone.org to Plone 3 **before the
conference begins**. I have created an OpenPlans project to help
coordinate efforts:
`http://www.openplans.org/projects/ploneorg-upgrade/project-home`_.

If you are interested in helping, please `join the project`_.
