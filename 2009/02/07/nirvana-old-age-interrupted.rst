[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec200NlbTA4&w=420&h=315] This is
a cover of Nirvana's "Old Age" and is absolutely hilarious. Not because
of my performance (although that is funny too) but because, while I
thought I had permission from my wife to make noise, you will see at the
end I most certainly did not!
