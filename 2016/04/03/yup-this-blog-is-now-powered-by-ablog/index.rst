After years of using Pelican for blogging and Sphinx for everything else, I began to notice and became annoyed that Pelican's `File metadata format <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html#file-metadata>`_ did not match Sphinx's `directives <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html#directives>`_. At the same time, I noticed that `ABlog <http://ablog.readthedocs.org/>`_ had matured enough to be usable.

So late last year I began converting all my blog entry metadata to Sphinx directives, and did quite a bit of clean up as well. I'm finally finished, and now ready to present the results (tada). Thank you Pelican for all the years of service, and thank you ABlog for helping me use Sphinx for blogging.
